# American Cream Drafts
## Origin
>The American Cream Drafts came from very meager origin. The entire breed was based on a single mare from Story County, Iowa. Old Granny, a cream mare, was auctioned off in a sale in 1991. Her ancestry was unknown, but her shiny cream coat and amber eyes captured an audience. This line was not very popular it consisted of only a few local farmers; that is until the birth of a stallion called Silver Lace. Born in 1932 he was a great- great grandson of Old Granny. Silver Lace was a very impressive figure; standing sixteen hands tall and weighing a whopping **two thousand two hundred pounds**. He managed to spark an interest in this draft breed in counties surrounding Melbourne, Iowa. The American Cream Draft is the only draft breed that originated in the United States.
