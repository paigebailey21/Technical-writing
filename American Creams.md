# American Cream Drafts
## Origins
> The American Cream Drafts came from very meager origin. The entire breed was based on a single mare from Story County, Iowa. Old Granny, a cream mare, was auctioned off in a sale in 1991. Her ancestry was unknown, but her shiny cream coat and amber eyes captured an audience.
