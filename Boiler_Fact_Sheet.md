##Flock Type
The first step in this project is to pick what breed of birds you want to raise. There are so many different breeds of chickens in the world; you need to find the one that fit your specific needs. Since this is a broiler project, a meat type bird would be the best choice. Here are a few great breeds to use for this project:
  Cornish
  White Plymouth Rock
  Brahma
  Orpington
  Cornish/White Plymouth Rock
Commercial broiler producers typically use the cornish/plymouth rock cross for their meat production. This cross is an extremely fast growing hybrid, bred to efficiently convert feed to meat. This particular cross feathers out rather fast and has the desired yellow skin. Depending on what you are specifically looking for, any of the above breeds would get the job done. The broilers should put on about one pound per week, and reach somewhere between 5-8 pounds. Therefore, the project usually takes 6-7 weeks to get the birds to their mature weight.
