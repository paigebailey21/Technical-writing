#Title
Titles are the most improtant.

#Summary 
I am not sure how to write a summary and an introduction, becuase they are basically the same. thing. 

#Introduction
My paper will probably be over how to raise a broiler chain for the fair. I have a lot of background knowledge. Introductions are usually my favorite part because you reel people in and then give them a breif view into the whole paper.
